          conducted in March 2021 concluded that around a third of adults living
          in the UK suffer from insomnia. When you are deprived of sleep, due to
          the amygdala being more reactive, you will be more likely to seek
          sensations or rewards. That, in turn, can cause further problems, like
          weight gain or addictions. You may also experience a decreased
          capacity to learn and memorise.

        <h3>Here are some tips to help you sleep better:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to bed at regular times every night.</li>
          <p>
            Developing your own bedtime routine may be a useful strategy to
            configure your biological clock, which helps regulate the circadian
            rhythm of your body. Once your body is programmed to sleep on your
            scheduled time you will not need to think about it, your internal
            body clock is there to make sure that you become fatigued,
            increasing your chances of having a restful sleep.
          </p>
          <li>Reduce blue light exposure at night.</li>
          <p>
            Studies have shown that exposure to blue light reduces the
            production of melatonin( often referred to as the sleep hormone).
            Melatonin production occurs in the pineal gland and is elicited by
            darkness. Light, however, stops it.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Normally, blue light peaks in the morning, signalling your body
              to wake up for the day. Red light increases in the evening,
              signalling that it is time to wind down and go to bed. By
              interrupting this natural cycle with the blue light emitted by
              electronic devices, the normal sleep-wake cycles are thrown out of
              whack.”<a

          <li>Put your phone away 30 minutes before bed.</li>
          <p>
            Aside from the negative effects of blue light on melatonin release,
            poor sleep quality can also be caused by excessive brain stimulation
            during bedtime. These days, mobile phones give us access to all
            kinds of entertainment, including videos, games, and social
            networks, all of which contribute to hyperarousal. Excessive brain
            stimulation pre-bedtime is likely to cause you to feel alert, which
            in turn has an effect on the quality of your sleep.Make sure to
            switch off your devices at least 30 minutes before bed.
